This website contains the following pages:

- Landing Page: The landing page gives more information bout the Web Summit such
  as the main program and the featured speakers also known as the speakers who
  are going to be speaking at the talk.

- About Page: The about page contains the information about the `Web Summit`
  conference and also links that would lead to pictures and slides about the
  past Web Summits.

- Ticket Page: The ticket page contains a table that contains ticket prices
  depending on the category of different users. On larger screens it is one big
  table, however, in smaller screens the table is split into two different
  tables.
